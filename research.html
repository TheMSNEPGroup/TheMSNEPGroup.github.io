                     <h3>Molecular Simulation of NonEquilibrium Processes</h3>
                     <hr>
                     <p>The MSNEP (Molecular Simulation of NonEquilibrium Processes) group focuses on elucidating the self-organization an communication processes that take place in a wide range of processes. This is achieved by developing novel computational chemistry algorithms to analyze, and rationalize, the colective response and emergence in molecular and active matter, In particular, the algorithms we have developed are based on statistical methods (Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics) and cover multiple timescales and length scales (tight-binding level, classical force fields, coarse-grained models, Brownian dynamics, continuum and Machine Learning techniques). To unravel nonequilibrium pathways, we have designed enhanced sampling algorithms that shed light on relaxation pathways (Expanded Wang-Landau sampling, order parameter-based sampling and ML-guided exploration), and nonequilibrium molecular or Brownian dynamics schemes for field-driven systems and active matter. Key phenomena we have recently focused on include: (i) nucleation, growth, polymorph selection and phase transitions, (ii) aggregaton processes in soft matter and living systems, (iii) field-induced pattern formation and fluctuation theorem, and (iv) cooperative and emergent behavior in active matter.

                              Living systems have the unique ability to form hierarchical assemblies, in which individual constituents can perform tasks cooperatively and emergently. Harnessing such properties is a long-standing challenge for the rational design of dynamic materials, that can respond to their environment, communicate with one another, and undergo a rapid, reversible, assembly through the transduction of energy. Recent developments in the design of smart and active colloidal building blocks have led to tremendous breakthroughs, with, for instance, the onset of synthetic photoactivated active assemblies known as “living crystals” that can form, break, explode and re-form elsewhere. In this work, we develop a combined experimental, computational, theoretical and Machine Learning framework to shed light on the physical underpinnings of such assembly processes and program the assembly of smart active materials.

                                 <p>Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in the U.S. Its early detection and diagnosis is key to increasing the success rate of cancer therapy. To this end, we develop ML algorithms and protocols to improve cancer detection and diagnostic tools. In a first project, we use image recognition algorithm to create a ML model with optimal predictive capabilities. In a second project, we focus on cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which has emerged as a very promising biomarker for the early detection of tumors. Leveraging deep learning, we propose to build a cancer prediction model using genetic and epigentic information.

                              Molecular crystals play an essential role in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, electronics, and defense industries. In many instances, a given chemical compound may have more than one crystal structure, a phenomenon known as polymorphism. A crystal may also contain impurities, the most important among these being water. Such structures are referred to as crystal hydrates. The ability of these materials to function in a desired manner may depend on which structure, pure or impure, they form. Utilizing advances in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence, we create new computational approaches and software components for rapidly predicting polymorphic structures in molecular crystals and understanding the transitions between structures.

                Because of their size, intermediate between the dimensions of atoms and of bulk matter, nanoscale materials often exhibit very unique properties. One needs, however, to be able to control the properties of nanomaterials, such as e.g. their crystalline structure, to fully harness the powerful properties of these materials. While physicists and synthetic chemists have developed many successful strategies to this end, a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of nanomaterials has remained elusive so far. Here, we use simulation methods appropriate for the sampling of rare events to elucidate this process, and shed light on the formation of nanoparticles and nanomaterials.

                  Dissipative systems, such as biological and synthetic nanomachines, often exhibit novel and unexpected properties. For instance, these systems exhibit a negative entropy production over finite length scales. This result is in sharp contrast with the second law of thermodynamica, that predicts that entropy production is always positive. In recent years, nonequilibrium relations known as fluctuation theorems, have emerged and provide a framework that promises to capture and harness this intriguing behavior. Using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and analyzing data through the fluctuation theorem, we unravel the complexity of nanomachines and their operation.

                       Nanoporous materials, including Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), have emerged in recent years as incredibly potent materials for the adsorption, storage and separation of molecular fluids. Such systems have applications in energy storage (methane or hydrogen storage for automotive applications), in environmental applications (carbon capture and sequestration, or the capture of environmental contaminants like PAHs) and in mixture separations (for instance, for the separation of light alkanes ofr automotive applications). We have developed a new simulation method, known as Expanded Wang-Landau simulations, that carries out an extensive sampling of the configuration space and allows to obtain the partition function of nanoconfined fluids. Combined with Machine Learning techniques, this method enables the rapid prediction of thermodynamic properties of adsorption for a wide range of gases and multicomponent mixtures.
