<!--                     <p>The MSNEP (MetaSimulation of NonEquilibrium Processes) group focuses on elucidating the self-organization and communication processes that take place in a wide range of phenomena in chemistry, biology, physics, engineering and materials science. We achieve this by creating novel simulation algorithms, but also by developing metasimulation and going beyond simulations through the use of AI and Machine Learning. In other words, we strive to find the most effective tactics available to address a challenge. Using these computational methods, we analyze, and rationalize, the collective response and emergence in molecular, biological and active matter. In particular, the algorithms we have developed are based on statistical methods (Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics and hybrid Monte Carlo) and cover multiple timescales and length scales (tight-binding level, classical force fields, coarse-grained models, Brownian dynamics and continuum). To unravel nonequilibrium pathways, we have designed enhanced sampling algorithms that shed light on relaxation pathways (Expanded Wang-Landau sampling, order parameter-based sampling, ML-based pattern recognition and classification, as well as ML-guided exploration), and nonequilibrium molecular or Brownian dynamics schemes for field-driven systems and active matter. Key phenomena we have recently focused on include: (i) nucleation, growth, polymorph selection and phase transitions, (ii) aggregation processes in soft matter and living systems, (iii) field-induced pattern formation and fluctuation theorem, and (iv) cooperative and emergent behavior in active matter.

                              Living systems have the unique ability to form hierarchical assemblies, in which individual constituents can perform tasks cooperatively and emergently. Harnessing such properties is a long-standing challenge for the rational design of dynamic materials, that can respond to their environment, communicate with one another, and undergo a rapid, reversible, assembly through the transduction of energy. Recent developments in the design of smart and active colloidal building blocks have led to tremendous breakthroughs, with, for instance, the onset of synthetic photoactivated active assemblies known as “living crystals” that can form, break, explode and re-form elsewhere. In this work, we develop a combined experimental, computational, theoretical and Machine Learning framework to shed light on the physical underpinnings of such assembly processes and program the assembly of smart active materials.

                              Molecular crystals play an essential role in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, electronics, and defense industries. In many instances, a given chemical compound may have more than one crystal structure, a phenomenon known as polymorphism. A crystal may also contain impurities, the most important among these being water. Such structures are referred to as crystal hydrates. The ability of these materials to function in a desired manner may depend on which structure, pure or impure, they form. Utilizing advances in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence, we create new computational approaches and software components for rapidly predicting polymorphic structures in molecular crystals and understanding the transitions between structures.

                Understanding and optimizing solid-solid interfaces in graphene-based nanocomposite catalysts is crucial for electrocatalytic applications such as CO2 reduction. Molecular functionalization of graphene offers enormous opportunities to prepare new electrocatalysts with enhanced electron transfer kinetics. Here we develop a new strategy for constructing innovative electrocatalysts from metal nanoclusters covalently attached onto three-dimensional pristine graphene electrodes through rationally designed molecular linkers. Using a combination of synthesis, computational modeling, electrochemistry, and spectroscopy, we shed light on how the control over solid-solid interfaces at the molecular level impacts the performance of nanocomposite materials in electrochemical devices.

             <p> Quantum materials exhibit exotic properties and thus lead to new phenomena and functionalities not expected from classical physics. Here, we propose a combined deep-learning theoretical physics approach to find innovative solutions for next-generation quantum technologies. In this project, we formulate novel theoretical frameworks and develop new physics-informed machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to manipulate and harness quantum states for computation, sensing, and communications.
