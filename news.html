                     <p> Using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we study the properties of supercooled liquids of Si under shear at T = 1060 K over a range of densities encompassing the low-density liquid (LDL) and high-density liquid (HDL) forms. This enables us to generate nonequilibrium steady-states of the LDL and HDL polymorphs that remain stabilized in their liquid forms for as long as the shear is applied. This is unlike the LDL and HDL forms at rest, which are metastable under those conditions and, when at rest, rapidly undergo a transition toward the crystal, i.e., the thermodynamically stable equilibrium phase. In particular, through a detailed analysis of the structural and energetic features of the liquids under shear, we identify the range of densities, as well as the range of shear rates, which give rise to the two forms. We also show how the competition between shear and tetrahedral order impacts the two-body entropy in steady-states of Si under shear. These results open the door to new ways of utilizing shear to stabilize forms that are metastable at rest and can exhibit unique properties, since, for instance, experiments on Si have shown that HDL is metallic with no bandgap, while LDL is semimetallic with a pseudogap. </p>

                     <p>A Mole of Chemistry: An Historical and Conceptual Approach to Fundamental Ideas in Chemistry is intended for students in their undergraduate years who need to learn the basics of chemistry, including science and engineering as well as humanities. This is a companion textbook which provides a unique perspective on how the main scientific concepts describing nature were discovered and, eventually, how modern chemistry was born. The book makes use of context found in history, philosophy and the arts to better understand their developments, and with as few mathematical equations as possible. The focus is then set on scientific reasoning, making this book a great companion and addition to traditional chemistry textbooks. </p>

                     <p>We develop several ensemble learning models to predict the partition function of fluids adsorbed in nanoporous materials. The partition functions so obtained allow rapid access to all thermodynamic properties of adsorption and provide an assessment of the performance of these materials over a wide range of conditions, without performing additional simulations. We examine different types of applications related to the environment and energy, including carbon capture and storage in IRMOF-1, hydrogen storage in COF-102, as well as the separation of light hydrocarbons, methane, and ethane in COF-102 and COF-108. A diversity ensemble learning approach, in which predictions obtained from neural networks with different architectures are averaged, is found to provide the most accurate predictions. Comparisons with simulation results obtained using grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations and flat-histogram methods establish the versatility of the ensemble learning model. Most notably, the new insights brought by the ensemble learning predictions include the rapid determination of the selectivity and of the desorption free energy over a wide range of operating conditions (pressure or mole fraction of the gas feed). This, in turn, provides a means to assess rapidly the performance of nanoporous materials for separation purposes, as well as of the energetic cost to regenerate the adsorbent..</p>
